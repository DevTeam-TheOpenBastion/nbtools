      "You can see that just putting a semicolon as the subscripting expression returns the whole sequence. Sometimes it's important to know that even under these circumstance _for mutable types_ slicing returns a new object copied from the original. You can confirm this by use of Python's [`id()` built-in function](http://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#id).\n",

Since the object cannot change, it does not matter. But a slicing operation promises you _your own copy of the data at the time the slice was taken_, which is why a new list is created even when all elements are included in the slice. If the source list later changes, your copy is insulated from those changes."
