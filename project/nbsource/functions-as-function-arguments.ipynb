      "The `format()` method, like all Python functions, can be called with two types of argument. The first type, and the one you are most familiar with, is called positional, because it is identified by the position it occupies in the argument list. The second type is called keyword; it's preceded by a name and an equals sign.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a call has any positional arguments, they must always appear before any keyword arguments. Thus, `\"...\".format(a, b, k1=c, k2=d)` is legal, but `\"...\".format(k1=c, k2=d, a, b)` is not (it will be flagged as a syntax error by the interpreter).\n",
      "\n",
      "The arguments to the `format()` method call are the values to be formatted. The format string on which the method is called specifies how the values are to be represented, by including replacement fields. Other text in the format string (that does not appear between curly brackets) is simply copied to the output literally."

The field name begins with either a number, which specifies a positional argument to the `format()` method, or a name, which specifies a named argument. This can be followed by extra information that allows you to index the selected argument (which will presumably be an indexable object such as a list, tuple, or dict) or access one of its attributes."
