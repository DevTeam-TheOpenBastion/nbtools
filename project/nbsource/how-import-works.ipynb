      "Suppose she wants to use a function that she wrote for an earlier program. If her solution is to open up the old source file, copy the routine and paste it into her new program, she is storing up trouble (you will often hear this referred to as _technical debt_). If later she makes a nifty improvement to the function she has to edit both source files to let them take advantage of the improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The correct approach (or one correct approach, anyway) is to extract the function into a separate _module_, a `.py` file containing code that can be imported and used by any program with access to it. In this way the task of maintenance is greatly eased: the source only has to be updated once for both programs to benefit. Learning how to split a program up into modules is something that only comes with experience, but it is easy to make a start."

It's good to read lots of code to gain that kind of experience in what modules the Python library offers and how to use them. Good modules to start with are `sys` and `os`."
