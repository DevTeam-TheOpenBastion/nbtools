Please check the executed notebook for clarity and correctness, either as you go or after execution.<br />Note that some cells are designed to produce exception tracebacks. Sometimes this can halt execution. If anything isn't obvious _[please raise an issue](https://github.com/holdenweb/intermediate-python/issues)_ - about anything you don't understand - and by all means attach a saved and downloaded copy of the notebook to add explanations or questions. Also please let us know about stuff you want to see covered under any heading in the `outline.txt` file.\n",
