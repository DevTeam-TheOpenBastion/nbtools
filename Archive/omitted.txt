OMITTED AFTER DUE CONSIDERATION

Using a source code control system (off-topic, complex)
Archival storage (zip, tar files: mostly of interest to ops types))
XML (a little too intimidating, perhaps)
Properties (too deep, definitely an advanced topic)
Classmethod, Staticmethod (too esoteric)
Interpreter guts (too complex)
Extension module authorship (too involved, platform-specific)
Namespace packages (too esoteric)
Generating PDFs with ReportLab (too involved)
